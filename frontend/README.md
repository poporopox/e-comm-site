# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Good to have you, by downloading this code you have a boiler plate, a well working e-comm site, by adding in the admin section a card of your choice and the users ability to add this to their cart. With an option for credit implementation. With an option for logging the uploaders id aswell while uploading nay card or the option to isolate the admin component so that only the chosen admin can upload given cards!
